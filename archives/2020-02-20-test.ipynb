    "## What is a time serie\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> a time serie is list of values collected at regular interval (in general). A univariate time serie represents one time serie (plot),per sample whereas the multivariate time series represents several time series (plots) per sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Time series can divided in to 3 categories:\n",
    "> 1- Time Series Classsification (TSC) : We present a time serie to a Neural Network (NN) model and the latter predicts its label (class). In this tutorial will be focused on this category\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2- Time Series Regression (TSR) : This is quiet similar to TSC and share the same data processing. It can be considered as specila case where the number of labels (classes) is reduced to 1, and represented by a float instead of a category. If it is confusing, rest assured we all had the same feeling at a given time of our learning journey. Every bit of information will become more clear as we advance in these tutorials: so hang on and we will reach our destination in a short time. \n",
    "\n",
    "> 3- Time Series Forecasting \n",
    "\n",
    "> In example, presented here below, we a multivariate time series. The data is generated by sensors on the hands, elbows, wrists and thumbs. The data are the x,y,z coordinates for each of the eight locations. For each sensor and each axis, we have a time serie that represent the value of x (or y, or z) during execution time of a command. For instance, channel 3 (ch3) on the graph shows the `Hand tip right, X coordinate` at different time laps. "
