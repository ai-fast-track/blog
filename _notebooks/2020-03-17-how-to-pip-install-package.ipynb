The answer relies on fact that fastai2 will install the latest version found in the **pypi repository** as opposed to the latest version found on **GitHub**. If the fastai2 GitHub version is using new features found in the fastcore latest GitHub version, it will lead to an incompatibility should you use fastai latest GitHub version combined with the fastcore pypi version: basically we are mixing 2 unaligned version. Consequently, we will end up experiencing some issues, and some errors will ultimately surface.
