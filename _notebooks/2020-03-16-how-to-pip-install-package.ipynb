In order to use the latest and the greatest version you can just install fastai2 from its GitHub repository."

The answer is because fastai2 will install the latest version found in the pypi repository and not the latest version found on GitHub. If the fastai github version is using the new capabilities found in the fastcore latest GitHub version. This will lead to an incompatibility if you are using fastai latest GitHub version mixed with the fastcore pypi version, you will end up have some issues and some errors will surface. Therefore, better to have the habit to pip install both of them using the same method (method 2 in this case)"
