Note: A doc link to an example website: fast.ai should also work fine. . Introduction . timeseries library is a Timeseries Classification and Regression package for fastai2. It mimics the fastai2 vision module (fastai2.vision).This tutorial shows how to train an end-to-end a timeseries dataset. The dataset example is the NATOPS dataset (see description here beow). . First, 4 different methods of creation on how to create timeseries dataloaders are presented. Then, we train a model based on Inception Time architecture . What is a time serie . a time serie is list of values collected at regular interval (in general). A univariate time serie represents one time serie (plot),per sample whereas the multivariate time series represents several time series (plots) per sample. . Time series can divided in to 3 categories: &gt; 1- Time Series Classsification (TSC) : We present a time serie to a Neural Network (NN) model and the latter predicts its label (class). In this tutorial will be focused on this category&gt; 2- Time Series Regression (TSR) : This is quiet similar to TSC and share the same data processing. It can be considered as specila case where the number of labels (classes) is reduced to 1, and represented by a float instead of a category. If it is confusing, rest assured we all had the same feeling at a given time of our learning journey. Every bit of information will become more clear as we advance in these tutorials: so hang on and we will reach our destination in a short time. 3- Time Series Forecasting . In example, presented here below, we a multivariate time series. The data is generated by sensors on the hands, elbows, wrists and thumbs. The data are the x,y,z coordinates for each of the eight locations. For each sensor and each axis, we have a time serie that represent the value of x (or y, or z) during execution time of a command. For instance, channel 3 (ch3) on the graph shows the Hand tip right, X coordinate at different time laps. . What is the goal of the time series classification? . Let&#39;s we ask our operator to execute the command #4: Spread wings and collect the sensors data (24 channels) and save as sample. We then . Our goal is train our Neural Network model with many examples (in our case, we will see that we 360 samples), and then when we feed our model a sensor data without knowing to which command (fro example #2: All clear) it corresponds, our model will able to predict that this sensor data correspond to the #2: All clear command. . (of say #4: Spread wings) in order to be able to tell us that . The goal is to provide our Neural Network model data of 24 channels (for a given sample : co) . Installation . . Note: There are may ways to install timeseries package. Since timeseries is built using fastai2, there are also different ways to install fastai2. We will show to differents ways to install them and explain the motivation behin each one of them. . Method 1 : Editable Version . 1A - Installing fastai2 . . Important: Only if you have not already installed fastai2, install fastai2 by following the steps described there. . 1B - Installing timeseries on a local machine . . Note: Installing an editable version of a package means that you will install a package from its corresponding github repository on your local machine. By doing so, you can pull the latest version whenever a new version is pushed. To install timeseries editable package, follow the instructions here below: . git clone https://github.com/ai-fast-track/timeseries.git cd timeseries pip install -e . . Method 2 : Non Editable version . . Note: Everytime you run the !pip install git+https:// ..., you are installing the package latest version stored on github. &gt; Important : As both fastai2 and timeseries are still under development, this is an easy way to use them in Google Colab or any other online platform. You can also use it on your local machine. . .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
